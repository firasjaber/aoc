# Advent of code 2022

This repo contains my solutions for the advent of code 2022
For each day, you will find its corresponding dir starting with 1, and for each dir, you will find both two puzzles with their input.
You can browse the puzzles [here](https://adventofcode.com/) so you get the context of each solution.

## About Advent of code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
On each day of the Advent calendar a new puzzle will be dropped with 2 parts.

My goal of participating is mostly for fun since I enjoy those kinds of programming puzzles, as well as practicing golang.

## Run solutions

To run a puzzle simply run its corresponding go file, for example for day one, first part, run the following:

```console
go run ./1/a/a.go
```

Of course you need golang to be installed, check that by running:

```console
go version
```
